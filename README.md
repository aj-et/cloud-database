# Overview

As a Software Engineer, I decided to learn about Cloud Database using Firebase.

This program implements user authentication where you will need to sign up in order to log in.

The purpose of writing this code is to learn how to use the cloud database

# Cloud Database

I am using Firebase as my cloud database where the user account (email and password) is saved.

My database uses the email as the identifier which they can use to login

# Development Environment

I only used React.JS and Firebase as my mai tools for this project.

React is a JavaScript library for building UI based on components.

# Future Work

Here are the stuff I want to implement in the future:

- When user log in, they will only see things that are unique to them.
- Better routing
- Better UI design
